# Student Grade Filter (Python OOP Beginner Project)

This is a **beginner-friendly console-based Python project** — a part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** learning journey.

## 🚀 What it Does
- Takes student names and grades as input from the user.
- Adds only students with grades **above 80** to a list.
- Stops collecting once 3 such top-performing students are added.
- Uses **classes**, **constructors**, and **methods** to structure the logic using OOP principles.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Defining a class using `class`
- Using `__init__()` to create constructors
- Working with `self` to refer to instance attributes
- Creating methods inside a class
- Appending data conditionally to a list
- Using a `while True:` loop and breaking based on a condition

## 📝 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script in terminal or any IDE:

```bash
python student_filter.py
